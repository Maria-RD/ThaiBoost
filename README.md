### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperlinks for Detailed Information

Transform the 'name' column text into hyperlinks. This enhancement directs users to dedicated pages providing in-depth information about each campaign.

On each campaign's dedicated page, showcase key attributes derived from the JSON data. This ensures users have a detailed and comprehensive view of each campaign.
